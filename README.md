# CaneExtensions

A set of [cane](https://github.com/square/cane) extensions that better
define the Everyday Hero
[styleguide](https://github.com/everydayhero/styleguide). At the moment
the only extra check is that every file contains a new line character at
the end. Future extensions will implement [Sandi Metz's four
rules](https://gist.github.com/henrik/4509394) and possibly enforce
seattle style brackets.
